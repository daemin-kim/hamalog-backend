# OAuth2 "Client ID Must Not Be Empty" Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The application was failing in production with the error:
```
client id of registration 'kakao' must not to be empty
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by inconsistent OAuth2 environment variable configuration between different configuration files:

1. **application.properties** used custom property names: `hamalog.oauth2.kakao.client-id`
2. **application-prod.properties** directly overrode Spring OAuth2 properties: `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.kakao.client-id=${KAKAO_CLIENT_ID}`
3. **Dockerfile** explicitly set `KAKAO_CLIENT_ID=""` and `KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET=""` as empty strings
4. **OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler** was designed to read `KAKAO_CLIENT_ID` from environment and map it to `hamalog.oauth2.kakao.client-id`

The configuration conflicts meant that even when environment variables were properly set, they weren't being recognized due to property name mismatches and empty string overrides.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed application-prod.properties
**Before:**
```properties
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.kakao.client-id=${KAKAO_CLIENT_ID:dummy-client-id-for-production}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.kakao.client-secret=${KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET:dummy-client-secret-for-production}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.kakao.redirect-uri=${KAKAO_REDIRECT_URI:https://your-domain.com/login/oauth2/code/kakao}
```

**After:**
```properties
# OAuth2 Production Settings
# Environment variables KAKAO_CLIENT_ID, KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET, and KAKAO_REDIRECT_URI
# are handled by OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler which maps them to the correct property names
# No need to override the OAuth2 client properties here - let the handler manage the mapping
```

### 2. Fixed Dockerfile
**Before:**
```dockerfile
ENV KAKAO_CLIENT_ID=""
ENV KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
# KAKAO_CLIENT_ID and KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET should be set at runtime
# Do not declare them with empty values as it prevents OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler from working
# Set them via: docker run -e KAKAO_CLIENT_ID=your_id -e KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
```

### 3. OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler (Already Working)
The existing OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler correctly:
- Reads `KAKAO_CLIENT_ID`, `KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `KAKAO_REDIRECT_URI` from environment
- Maps them to internal property names: `hamalog.oauth2.kakao.client-id`, etc.
- Provides fallback values when environment variables are null or empty
- Handles both production and development environments

## Verification
The fix was verified by:
1. Testing application startup without OAuth2 errors (no "client id must not be empty" errors occurred)
2. Confirming proper environment variable handling for both undefined and empty values
3. Validating that OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler works as designed

## Files Modified
- `src/main/resources/application-prod.properties` - Removed conflicting OAuth2 property overrides
- `Dockerfile` - Removed empty environment variable declarations

## Deployment Configuration Status
✅ **docker-compose.yml** - Already correctly configured with fallback values
✅ **GitHub Actions workflow** - Already properly sets environment variables from secrets
✅ **OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler** - Working as designed

## Production Deployment
The fix ensures that in production:
1. Environment variables `KAKAO_CLIENT_ID` and `KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET` are read from GitHub secrets
2. OAuth2EmptyVariableHandler maps them to the correct Spring OAuth2 properties  
3. No configuration conflicts occur between different property sources
4. Application starts successfully without "client id must not be empty" errors

## Impact
- ✅ Resolves production startup failures related to OAuth2 configuration
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing deployment processes
- ✅ No changes required to CI/CD pipelines or secret management
- ✅ Preserves fallback behavior for development environments
