## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (Phase 1 - Week 1)

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] **[CRITICAL] JWT Token Exposure in Logs** - Remove token logging from JwtTokenProvider.validateToken(), log only validation results
- [x] **[CRITICAL] JWT Token in URL Parameters** - Fix OAuth2AuthenticationSuccessHandler to use secure cookies instead of URL parameters
- [x] **[CRITICAL] Hardcoded JWT Secret** - Replace weak Base64 JWT secret with strong environment variable-based secret
- [x] **[CRITICAL] Authorization Bypass (IDOR)** - Implement proper authorization checks in all controllers to prevent users accessing other members' data
- [x] **[CRITICAL] OAuth2 Credentials Exposed** - Move OAuth2 client credentials to environment variables with proper documentation

### Input Validation & Security
- [x] **Missing Input Validation on Login** - Add @NotBlank validation to LoginRequest DTO fields
- [x] **Ineffective Logout Implementation** - Implement proper token blacklist mechanism (already partially implemented)
- [x] **Weak OAuth2 User Creation** - Fix default values and require proper user data completion flow

- [ ] **Add Audit Trail Support** - Implement CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate, CreatedBy, LastModifiedBy using Spring Data JPA auditing

### Exception Handling
- [ ] **Standardize Exception Messages** - Move hardcoded Korean messages to message bundles for internationalization
- [ ] **Improve Exception Logging** - Add proper logging context in JwtAuthenticationFilter exception handling
- [ ] **Create Custom Exception Hierarchy** - Organize exceptions by domain (auth, medication, sideEffect) with specific error codes

---

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS (Phase 3 - Week 3-4)

### Code Consistency & Standards
- [ ] **Standardize Dependency Injection** - Use @RequiredArgsConstructor consistently across all classes instead of mixed constructor approaches
- [ ] **Improve Builder Pattern Usage** - Use Builder pattern consistently in services instead of manual constructor calls
- [ ] **Fix Date Handling** - Replace string parsing with proper LocalDate validation and formatting
- [ ] **Implement Soft Delete** - Add soft delete capability to entities instead of hard delete
- [ ] **Add Entity Validation** - Add proper JPA validation annotations to entity fields

### API Design & Documentation
- [ ] **Implement API Versioning** - Add version prefixes to API endpoints (/api/v1/)
- [ ] **Improve OpenAPI Documentation** - Add detailed examples and error response documentation
- [ ] **Standardize HTTP Status Codes** - Use appropriate status codes consistently (201 for creation, 204 for deletion)
- [ ] **Add Request/Response Logging** - Implement structured request/response logging with correlation IDs

### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Implement Profile-based Configuration** - Create separate application-{profile}.properties files for dev/test/prod
- [ ] **Add Connection Pool Configuration** - Configure HikariCP connection pool settings
- [ ] **Environment-specific URLs** - Replace hardcoded localhost URLs with environment-configurable values
- [ ] **Add Health Check Endpoints** - Enable Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and health checks

## ðŸŸ¢ PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY (Phase 4 - Week 5-6)

### Database Performance
- [ ] **Implement Query Optimization** - Add @EntityGraph to prevent N+1 query problems
- [ ] **Add Database Connection Monitoring** - Configure connection pool metrics and monitoring
- [ ] **Implement Database Migration** - Add Flyway or Liquibase for database version control
- [ ] **Add Query Performance Logging** - Enable slow query logging and analysis

### Caching & Performance
- [ ] **Implement Application Caching** - Add Spring Cache with Redis for frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Add File Upload Optimization** - Implement file compression and thumbnail generation
- [ ] **Implement API Rate Limiting** - Add rate limiting with Redis or in-memory storage
- [ ] **Add Performance Monitoring** - Integrate Micrometer metrics for application monitoring

### Security Hardening
