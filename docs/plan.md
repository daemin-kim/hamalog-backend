- **Service Layer Refactoring**: Extract business rules into strategy pattern implementations for medication validation and user registration

#### Technical Implementation:
```java
// Example Domain Event
public class MedicationScheduleCreatedEvent {
    private final Long medicationScheduleId;
    private final Long memberId;
    private final LocalDateTime createdAt;
    // Event data and metadata
}

// Event Handler
@EventHandler
public class MedicationScheduleEventHandler {
    public void handleMedicationScheduleCreated(MedicationScheduleCreatedEvent event) {
        // Update caches, send notifications, audit logging
    }
}
```

#### Expected Benefits:
- **Reduced Coupling**: Services become more focused on business logic
- **Better Testability**: Easier to mock and test individual components
- **Improved Audit Trail**: Automatic event logging for all domain changes

@RequireResourceOwnership(
    resourceType = ResourceType.MEDICATION_SCHEDULE,
    ownerField = "memberId",
    strategy = OwnershipStrategy.DIRECT
)
public ResponseEntity<MedicationScheduleResponse> getMedicationSchedule(@PathVariable Long id) {
    // Controller logic
}

// Security Headers Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app.security.headers")
public class SecurityHeadersConfig {
    private String contentTypeOptions = "nosniff";
    private String frameOptions = "DENY";
    private String referrerPolicy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
}
```

    String timestamp,
    String path,
    Map<String, Object> details
) {}

// Domain-Specific Exception
public class MedicationException extends CustomException {
    public MedicationException(MedicationErrorCode errorCode, Object... args) {
        super(errorCode, args);
    }
}

// Internationalization
@Service
public class MessageService {
    private final MessageSource messageSource;
    
    public String getMessage(String code, Object... args) {
        return messageSource.getMessage(code, args, LocaleContextHolder.getLocale());
    }
}
```

@EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"member", "medicationTimes"})
@Query("SELECT ms FROM MedicationSchedule ms WHERE ms.member.memberId = :memberId")
Page<MedicationSchedule> findByMemberIdWithDetails(@Param("memberId") Long memberId, Pageable pageable);

// Proper JPA Cascade
@Entity
public class Member {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "member", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<MedicationSchedule> medicationSchedules = new ArrayList<>();
}

// Database Index Configuration
@Table(name = "member", indexes = {
    @Index(name = "idx_member_login_id", columnList = "login_id"),
    @Index(name = "idx_member_created_at", columnList = "created_at")
})
public class Member {
    // Entity definition
}
```
