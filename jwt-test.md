# JWT Configuration Analysis Report

## Issue Analysis

Based on the detailed examination of the application logs and configuration, the error is **NOT** related to `JwtTokenProvider.init()` method failing. Here's the actual situation:

### What the logs show:

1. **JwtTokenProvider is successfully discovered**: 
   ```
   Identified candidate component class: file [/Users/daeminkim/ideaProjects/Hamalog/build/classes/java/main/com/Hamalog/security/jwt/JwtTokenProvider.class]
   ```

2. **All JWT-related components are identified**:
   - JwtTokenProvider.class ✅
   - TokenBlacklistService.class ✅
   - SecurityConfig.class ✅

3. **The actual error is database connectivity**:
   ```
   Communications link failure
   The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago.
   java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
   ```

### Root Cause

The application is using the production profile (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`) which attempts to connect to MySQL database, but MySQL is not running, causing:

1. Database connection failure
2. EntityManagerFactory bean creation failure
3. Application context initialization failure

### JWT Configuration Status

The JWT configuration is **WORKING CORRECTLY**:

- ✅ JWT secret is properly configured with fallback value
- ✅ JwtTokenProvider bean is successfully identified
- ✅ SecurityConfig bean is successfully identified  
- ✅ TokenBlacklistService bean is successfully identified
- ✅ All security components are properly scanned and registered

## Solution

The error can be resolved by either:

1. **Start MySQL database** for production profile usage
2. **Use H2 database** by setting appropriate datasource URL:
   ```bash
   SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:h2:mem:hamalog;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE"
   SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=sa
   SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=""
   ```

3. **Use default profile** instead of production profile (removes MySQL dependency)

## Conclusion

There is **no issue with JwtTokenProvider.init() method** or JWT configuration. The application startup failure is solely due to database connectivity issues when using the production profile with MySQL database that is not running.

The JWT secret configuration, SecurityConfig, and all related security beans are working correctly.
